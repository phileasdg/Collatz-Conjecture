# Introduction

[![Collatz Conjecture XKCD comic](3x+1_files/collatz_conjecture.png)](https://xkcd.com/710/)

From [Collatz conjecture, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture):  

"Start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous 
term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the 
previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous 
term plus 1.

**The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.**"

## The rules as R functions

```{r}
collatz_even <- function(even_int){
  return(even_int / 2)
}

collatz_odd <- function(odd_int){
  return(3 * odd_int + 1)
}
```

## Brute force algorithm

First of all, let's decide on a range of starting values for which we would like 
to compute the trajectories of the Collatz sequences, and a maximum number of steps
to compute for any starting value.

```{r}
seeds <- 1:10000
max_s <- 1000
```

Now let's define a function that computes the trajectories and returns:

```{r}
collatz_brute_force <- function(start_int, max_steps = 1000){
  new_val <- start_int
  steps <- c(new_val)
  step_count <- 0
  
  # This while statement could never disprove the Collatz conjecture if one start 
  # integer were to lead to infinity, because it has no way of knowing that the 
  # there is no solution, and without a break condition, it would naively keep 
  # running the function ad infinitum. (it has been shown that there are no 
  # starting values that disprove the Collatz conjecture inferior to 2^68)
  
  while(new_val != 1) {
    step_count <- step_count + 1
    if(new_val %% 2 == 0){
      new_val <- collatz_even(new_val)
      steps <- c(steps, new_val)}
    else{
      new_val <- collatz_odd(new_val)
      steps <- c(steps, new_val)}
    if(step_count > max_steps){
      break
    }
  }
  return(list(steps))
}
```

## Brute force data collection

```{r}
# collecting the data
collatz_data <- data.frame(seed = seeds)

collatz_data <- collatz_data %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(sequence = list(collatz_brute_force(seed, max_steps = max_s))) %>% 
  unnest(sequence) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(max_val = max(sequence),
         n_steps = length(sequence)) %>% 
  mutate(step_index = list(1:n_steps))

collatz_data
```

## Plots (respecting the rules)

Before we break the rules, let's take a look at how our computed Collatz sequences 
plot.

First of all, let's plot a random Collatz sequence from our data frame:

```{r}
# standard plot
set.seed(0)
seed_value <- sample(seeds, 1)

collatz_data %>% 
  filter(seed == seed_value)%>% 
  select(sequence) %>% 
  unnest(sequence) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = 1:length(sequence), y = sequence)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "step", y = "value", title = print(paste0("Collatz sequence with starting value = ", seed_value)))
```

Glad that worked! Now let's plot the same data on a log-log figure:

```{r}
# semi-log plot
collatz_data %>% 
  filter(seed == seed_value)%>% 
  select(sequence) %>% 
  unnest(sequence) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = (1:length(sequence)), y = log(sequence))) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "step", y = "log(value)", title = print(paste0("Collatz sequence with starting value = ", seed_value)))
```

Excellent! How neat! Now let's try to plot all our computed trajectories together 
starting from their seed values:

```{r}
# preparing the data
collatz_sequences <- collatz_data %>% 
  select(seed, sequence, step_index) %>%
  unnest(c(sequence, step_index)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -c(step_index, seed), names_to = "variable", values_to = "values") %>% 
  select(-variable)
```

Let's plot the same two plots as above + a log-log plot, but with partly transparent 
lines so that we can detect overlaps in trajectories by looking at the opacity of 
the lines on the plots.

```{r}
# standard plot
collatz_sequences %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = step_index, y = values, colour = as.factor(seed))) +
  geom_line() + theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = paste0("Collatz sequences for starting values in range: ", range(seeds)[1], " - ", range(seeds)[2]),
       x = "step", y = "value")

# semi-log plot
collatz_sequences %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = (step_index), y = log(values), colour = as.factor(seed))) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.1) + theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = paste0("Collatz sequences for starting values in range: ", range(seeds)[1], " - ", range(seeds)[2]),
       x = "step", y = "log(value)")

# log-log plot
collatz_sequences %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log(step_index), y = log(values), colour = as.factor(seed))) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.1) + theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = paste0("Collatz sequences for starting values in range: ", range(seeds)[1], " - ", range(seeds)[2]),
       x = "log(step)", y = "log(value)")
```

Look at that! Pretty cool huh! And interesting that on the third plot you can 
observe this fractal regularity in the variance of different lines!

You can see in the first and second plots that it looks like some sequence paths are repeated 
with an offset. Perhaps they line up at their ends. Let's get visual evidence by 
plotting the plots above with the steps reversed, starting at the bottom left of 
plots with the end of the sequences:

```{r}
# preparing the data
collatz_sequences_rev <- collatz_data %>% 
  select(seed, sequence, step_index) %>%
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(step_index = list(rev(step_index))) %>% 
  unnest(c(sequence, step_index)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -c(step_index, seed), names_to = "variable", values_to = "values") %>% 
  select(-variable) 

# standard plot
collatz_sequences_rev %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = step_index, y = values, colour = as.factor(seed))) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.4) + theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = paste0("Reversed Collatz sequences for starting values in range: ", range(seeds)[1], " - ", range(seeds)[2]),
       x = "step", y = "value")

# semi-log plot
collatz_sequences_rev %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = step_index, y = log(values), colour = as.factor(seed))) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.1) + theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = paste0("Reversed Collatz sequences for starting values in range: ", range(seeds)[1], " - ", range(seeds)[2]),
       x = "step", y = "log(value)")

# log-log plot
collatz_sequences_rev %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log(step_index), y = log(values), colour = as.factor(seed))) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.1) + theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = paste0("Reversed Collatz sequences for starting values in range: ", range(seeds)[1], " - ", range(seeds)[2]),
       x = "log(step)", y = "log(value)")
```

Looks like we were right! Okay, now before we start messing around and relax our 
conformity to the conditions of the Collatz conjecture, let's make a couple other 
exploratory plots.

```{r}
collatz_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = seed, y = n_steps, colour = log(max_val))) +
  geom_point(size = .6) +

  labs(title = paste0("Steps to 1 for Collatz sequences with starting values in range: ", 
                      range(seeds)[1], " - ", range(seeds)[2]),
       x = "starting value", y = "number of steps to 1", colour = "log(highest reached point)") +
  theme(legend.position="bottom") +
  scale_color_gradientn(colours = rainbow(2))

collatz_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log(seed), y = log(max_val), colour = n_steps)) +
  geom_point(size = .6) + 
  labs(title = paste0("Highest reached points \nfor Collatz sequences with starting values in range: ", 
                      range(seeds)[1], " - ", range(seeds)[2]),
       x = "log(starting value)", y = "log(highest point)", colour = "n steps to 1") +
  scale_color_gradientn(colours = rainbow(2))

collatz_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log(seed), y = log(max_val-seed), colour = n_steps)) +
  geom_point(size = .6) +
  labs(title = paste0("Highest reached points above initial value \nfor Collatz sequences with starting values in range: ", range(seeds)[1], " - ", range(seeds)[2]),
       x = "log(starting value)", y = "log(highest point - starting value)", colour = "n steps to 1") +
  scale_color_gradientn(colours = rainbow(2))
```

What do all these cool patterns mean? I have no idea, I'm not a mathematician (yet).
But they are sure fun to compute!

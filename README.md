This repository contains a fun little R exploration of Collatz sequences and the Collatz conjecture. I don't get very far in my exploration, and my goal is not to prove or disprove it (nor, I suspect, would I get close if I tried, and besides, we know it must be true for almost all values, and is true for all values that I have the time and dedication to compute on my laptop), but I still had fun playing around with sequences and graphs, and I might revisit this project later and mess around with it more, who knows? :)
